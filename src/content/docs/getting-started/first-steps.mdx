Welcome to blxshell! Here's what to do after your first login.

### Keybinds important to know

Try these essential shortcuts:

| Action | Keybind | Expected Result |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Terminal | `Super + Return` | Ghostty(Terminal) opens |
| Launcher | `Super + Space` | Search overlay appears |
| Settings | `Super + S` | Settings panel opens |
| Wallpaper | `Super + W` | Wallpaper changes |
| Lock screen | `Super + L` | Lockscreen appears |
| Power menu | `Super + Escape` | Shutdown/reboot/logout menu |

### Lockscreen & Power Menu

blxshell includes a built-in lockscreen and power menu controlled via IPC:

```bash
# Lock screen
qs ipc call lockscreen lock

# Power menu
qs ipc call -- powermenu toggle
```

These are already bound to `Super + L` and `Super + Escape` by default.

### Verify Colors

Your theme should match your wallpaper:

```bash
cat ~/.config/hypr/colors.conf
# Should show Material Design 3 colors
```

matugen image /path/to/wallpaper.png

# Colors auto-apply to:

# - Quickshell (bar, widgets)
# - GTK apps

```

### Change Fonts

System-wide font in Quickshell:

```json
// ~/.config/quickshell/config.json
{
  "fontFamily": "Rubik",  // Try: Bitcount Single, JetBrains Mono
  "fontSize": 14
}
```

### Adjust Gaps and Borders

Edit `~/.config/hypr/visual/general.conf`:

```conf
general {
    gaps_in = 3       # Inner gaps
    gaps_out = 5      # Outer gaps
    border_size = 1   # Window border thickness
}
```

## Set Up Autostart

Edit `~/.config/hypr/autostart.conf`:

```conf
# Already running:
exec-once = qs &  # Quickshell
exec-once = dex -a -s ~/.config/autostart/ &

# Add your apps:
# exec-once = firefox &
# exec-once = spotify &
# exec-once = discord &
```
